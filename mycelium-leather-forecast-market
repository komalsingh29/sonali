Mycelium leather is a mushroom-based imitation leather. It is highly similar to the animal leather which makes it a potential substitute. In order to create mycelium leather, mycelium cells are placed on a dish in a lab, and with enough cellulose-rich nutrients, the mycelium grows fibres called hyphae. The by-products are then shaped into thin panels. After that, sawdust is then mixed with nutrients and mixed with mushroom spores in “bag logs” which are simply individual bags. These bags are left in an incubation room for the span of a month. After this period of time, the mycelium is harvested, treated and coloured to appear as animal leather.
