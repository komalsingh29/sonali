Microprocessor & Microcontroller Trends:
The Microprocessor (MPU) and Microcontroller (MCU) segments experienced stagnant growth, largely due to weak shipments and limited investments in traditional computing devices such as notebooks, desktops, and standard PCs. However, this stagnation is counterbalanced by a surge in IoT-based electronics, which is fueling demand for more powerful and efficient processing units.

Hybrid MPUs and MCUs, which integrate real-time embedded processing and control capabilities, are gaining traction in top-tier IoT applications, leading to significant growth opportunities in the mid-to-long term.

Analog IC Market Dynamics:
The Analog IC segment is anticipated to grow steadily, supported by:

Signal conversion requirements

Automotive-specific analog applications

Power management demands

These trends are concurrently driving the increased adoption of discrete power devices, particularly within sectors like automotive electronics, industrial automation, and smart appliances.

Following a strong 26.2% growth in 2021, the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) revised its forecast for the global semiconductor market in 2022 to single-digit growth, mainly due to rising inflation and weakened demand across consumer-driven end markets. Despite the slowdown, the market still expanded by 4.4%, reaching a total size of US$580 billion in 2022.
