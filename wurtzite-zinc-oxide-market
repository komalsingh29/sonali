Zinc oxide is an inorganic compound with the formula ZnO. ZnO is a white powder that is insoluble in water, and it is widely used as an additive in numerous materials and products including rubbers, plastics, ceramics, glass, etc. Although it occurs naturally as the mineral zincite, most zinc oxide is produced synthetically. The wurtzite structure is most stable at ambient conditions and thus most common.
