Ethylene carbonate is the organic compound with the formula (CH2O)2CO. It is classified as the carbonate ester of ethylene glycol and carbonic acid. At room temperature (25 °C) ethylene carbonate is a transparent crystalline solid, practically odorless and colorless, and somewhat soluble in water. In the liquid state (m.p. 34-37 °C) it is a colorless odorless liquid. As ethylene carbonate is a highly polar solvent and dissolves large amount of electrolyte, it is mainly used in lithium batteries electrolyte solution. It can also readily dissolve polymers leading to use as a release agent and detergent.
