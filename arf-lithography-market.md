The global ArF Lithography Market was valued at 11150 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 18940 million by 2031, at a CAGR of 8.1% during the forecast period.

ArF Lithography Market Overview
A wide range of products such as smartphones and electrical appliances are becoming smaller and more functional, and all are now part of everyday life. Semiconductor lithography technology is making a significant contribution to the evolution of semiconductors (semiconductor integrated circuits), which are indispensable components of these products.
A semiconductor lithography system undertakes a process whereby highly complex circuit patterns drawn on a photomask made of a large glass plate are reduced using ultra-high-performance lenses and exposed onto a silicon substrate known as a wafer.
Semiconductor lithography equipment include EUV lithography machine, ArFi lithography machine, ArF dry lithography machine, KrF lithography machine and i-line lithography machine.

This report focuses on the global ArF Lithography Equipment Market, which includes both ArF Dry and ArFi Immersion Lithography Machines.
